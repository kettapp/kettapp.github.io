- you are able to demonstrate that you have followed the program pursuant to the requirements stated below in Section “How to demonstrate that you have followed the program”.

We will review your application and notify you (by email or otherwise) whether your application is approved.

## HOW TO DEMONSTRATE THAT YOU HAVE FOLLOWED THE PROGRAM

### IMPORTANT STATEMENT

Please note that only fulfillment of the above requirements allows you to receive a refund under the Money-back Guarantee. For the sake of clarity, this Money-back Guarantee does not apply to any other instances.

## GENERAL REFUND RULES

We value any feedback and do everything to make our customers happy with our products and services. However, if you are not completely satisfied with our services, you can get a refund according to the terms provided herein.

Generally, if you do not meet the conditions of our Money-back Guarantee set out above, the fees you have paid are non-refundable and/or non-exchangeable, unless otherwise is stated herein or as required by applicable law. In addition, certain refund requests may be considered by our company on a case-by-case basis and granted at our sole discretion.

A refund can usually be claimed only during the subscription period. If the subscription period has expired before you made a request for a refund, we will not be able to provide you with a refund.

Note for residents of certain US states. If you reside in California or Connecticut and cancel the purchase at any time prior to midnight of the third business day after the date of such purchase, we will return the payment you have made.

Note for the EU residents: If you are an EU resident, you have the right to withdraw from the agreement for purchase of digital content without charge and without giving any reason within fourteen (14) days from the date of such agreement conclusion. The withdrawal right does not apply if the performance of the agreement has begun with your prior express consent and your acknowledgment that you thereby lose your right of withdrawal. YOU HEREBY EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE IMMEDIATE PERFORMANCE OF THE AGREEMENT AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU WILL LOSE YOUR RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL FROM THE AGREEMENT ONCE OUR SERVERS VALIDATE YOUR PURCHASE AND THE APPLICABLE PURCHASE IS SUCCESSFULLY DELIVERED TO YOU. Therefore, you will not be eligible for a refund, unless the digital content is defective.
