Deleting the app does not cancel your subscriptions and trials. We also aim to provide information about our subscription policies at or near the point of purchase. Please review these policies prior to making purchases. You may wish to make a printscreen of this information for your reference.

6.2. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, we may change Purchase fees at any time. We will give you reasonable notice of any such pricing changes by posting the new prices on or through the App and/or by sending you an e-mail notification, or in other prominent way.

6.4. By signing up for certain subscriptions, you agree that your subscription may be automatically renewed. Unless you cancel your subscription you authorize us and the App Stores to charge you for the renewal term. The period of auto-renewal will be the same as your initial subscription period unless otherwise disclosed to you on the Service.

This arbitration agreement governs any dispute between you and the company (and each of our respective agents, corporate parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns) including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and the Company, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; claims that arose before these Terms or any prior agreement; and claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms (“Dispute”), except claims that can be brought in small claims court if your claims qualify within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.

Without limiting the preceding sentence, you will also have the right to litigate any other Dispute if you opt out of this arbitration and class action waiver provisions by sending electronic notice of your decision to opt out to support@betterme.world with the subject line, "ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT" within 30 days of (a) the effective date of these Terms; or (b) your first date that you used the Service that contained any versions of the Terms that substantially included this version of the Arbitration Agreement (including class action waiver), whichever is later. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, the Company also will not be bound by it and any Dispute shall be resolved in accordance with Section 15. If you don’t exercise the right to opt out, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except claims that can be brought in small claims court.

We are always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently. If you have any dispute with the Company, you agree that before taking any formal action, you will contact us at support@betterme.world, and provide a brief, written description of the dispute and your contact information.

### d. Waiver of Class Action and Collective Relief

THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIMS TO BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON A CLASS ACTION, JOINT OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS OR ON BASES INVOLVING CLAIMS BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC, OTHER USERS OF THE SERVICES, OR ANY OTHER PERSONS. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT INDIVIDUAL PARTY’S CLAIM. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT AWARD RELIEF FOR OR AGAINST ANYONE WHO IS NOT A PARTY. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND COLLECTIVE RELIEF IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION AND CANNOT BE SEVERED FROM IT.

BY AGREEING TO THE ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES AS SET FORTH HEREIN, YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND LIMITING YOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHTS TO OTHER AVAILABLE RESOLUTION PROCESSES, SUCH AS A COURT ACTION.

THE ARBITRATOR HAS NO AUTHORITY TO AWARD PUNITIVE DAMAGES.

### e. Arbitration Procedures.

- Overview. Arbitration is an alternative to litigation where a neutral person (the arbitrator) hears and decides the parties’ Dispute. Arbitration proceedings are designed to provide parties with a fair hearing in a manner that is faster and less formal than court proceedings. The following procedures (the “Arbitration Procedures”) are applicable to all arbitration proceedings involving you and us.

- Seat of Arbitration. The seat of the arbitration shall be:

(a) if you are not a U.S. resident, London, United Kingdom;

(b) if you are a U.S. resident, Delaware, U.S.

- Choice of Law. The governing law applicable to the arbitration agreement and the arbitration shall be:

(a) if you are not a U.S. resident, the laws of England and Wales (also known as English Law), without regard to English Law’s conflict of laws rules; or

(b) if you are a U.S. resident, Delaware law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, having regard to claims of privilege recognized at law.

- Language. The language of the arbitration shall be English.

- Commencing an Arbitration. To start an arbitration, you must follow instructions available at:

(a) https://www.lcia.org/adr-services/lcia-notes-for-parties.aspx#5.%20COMMENCING%20AN%20LCIA%20ARBITRATION for LCIA; or

(b) https://www.jamsadr.com/submit/ for JAMS.

You may represent yourself in the arbitration or have a lawyer (or some other representative) act on your behalf. Upon receipt of an arbitration claim, we may assert any counterclaims we may have against the complaining party.

- Fees. If you are a consumer and you initiate arbitration against us, the only filing fee you will be required to pay is USD 250 and the rest of the filing fees (if any) shall be borne by us. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration initiated by you to be non-frivolous and/or not in bad faith we will cover all other arbitration costs, including case management fees and all professional fees for the arbitrator's services (but not your attorneys’ fees, if any).

If we initiate arbitration against you and you are a consumer, we will pay for all costs associated with the arbitration (but not your attorneys’ fees, if any).

The parties shall be responsible for paying their own attorneys’ fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.

Should either party bring a Dispute involving issues subject to arbitration in a forum other than arbitration, the court or the arbitrator shall have the authority to award reasonable costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, incurred by the other party in successfully staying or dismissing, in whole or in part, such other proceeding or in otherwise enforcing compliance with this Arbitration Agreement.

- Selection of the Arbitrator. The arbitrator who will hear and decide your Dispute will be appointed by the LCIA or JAMS, as applicable, in accordance with their respective rules.

Arbitration Hearings. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference (based on written and/or electronic filing of documents), rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances, provided that if you are a consumer, you have a right to an in-person hearing in your hometown area. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the administrator of arbitration or by the arbitrator.

- Discovery. Each party may (a) request relevant, non-privileged documents from the other party; and (b) request that the other party provide the particulars of its claims or defenses. Any such discovery requests must be served on the other party within 10 days after the arbitrator’s appointment. The responding party shall provide the requesting party with all responsive, non-privileged documents, the requested particulars, and/or any objections to the requests within 15 days after receipt of the requests. Any disputes about discovery or requests for extensions shall be submitted promptly to the arbitrator for prompt resolution. In ruling on any discovery dispute or extension request, the arbitrator shall take into consideration the nature, amount, and scope of the underlying arbitration claim, the cost and other effort what would be involved in providing the requested discovery, the case schedule, and whether the requested discovery is necessary for the adequate preparation of a claim or defense.

- Communications with the Arbitrator. Whenever communicating with the arbitrator, the parties must include each other – for example, by including the other party on a telephone conference call and copying the other party on any written submissions, such as letters or emails. To the extent practicable, conferences with the arbitrator will take place by telephone conference call or email. Ex parte communications are not permitted with any arbitrator.

- Confidentiality. Upon either party’s request, the arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted filing of confidential information must be done under seal.

- Arbitration Award. The arbitrator will render a written decision within 14 days after the hearing or, if no hearing was held, within 30 days after any rebuttal or supplemental statements are due. The decision must clearly specify the relief, if any, awarded and contain a brief statement of the reasons for the award.

- Waiver of Appeal. The parties agree that the award shall be final and binding upon the parties and waive any right to refer any question of law and any right of appeal on the law and/or the merits to any court.

Consumer Remedies. If you are a consumer, remedies that would otherwise be available to you under applicable laws will remain available under this Arbitration Agreement, unless you retain the right to pursue such remedies in court as per this Agreement.

### f. Severability of Arbitration Agreement

If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Arbitration Agreement or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in court in accordance with Section 15, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Arbitration Agreement is found to prohibit an individual from seeking the remedy of public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Arbitration Agreement will be enforceable.

### g. Survival

This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Terms.
