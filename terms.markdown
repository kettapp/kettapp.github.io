# Terms of Service

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE

This service includes subscriptions that automatically renew. Please read these terms and conditions of use (the “Terms”) carefully (in particular, Section 6 “subscription fees and payment”) before starting a trial or completing a purchase for our app’s auto-renewing subscription service. To avoid being charged you must affirmatively cancel your subscription at least 24 hours before the end of the free trial or then-current subscription period.

If you are unsure how to cancel a subscription or a free trial, please visit the Apple support website, Google Play help (or any other app stores support pages), or our website depending on where you have purchased your subscription. Deleting the app does not cancel your subscriptions and trials. We also aim to provide information about our subscription policies at or near the point of purchase. Please review these policies prior to making purchases. You may wish to make a printscreen of this information for your reference.

PLEASE NOTE: THESE TERMS CONTAIN A BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION IN SECTION 14 THAT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THESE TERMS. THE ARBITRATION PROVISION REQUIRES THAT DISPUTES BE RESOLVED IN ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. IN ARBITRATION, THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY AND THERE IS LESS APPELLATE REVIEW THAN IN COURT. EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED BELOW IN SECTION 14, UNLESS YOU OPT OUT WITHIN 30 DAYS OF FIRST USE OF OUR SERVICE AS PROVIDED FOR IN SECTION 14, ARBITRATION IS THE EXCLUSIVE VENUE FOR ANY AND ALL DISPUTES AND IS MANDATORY.

FURTHERMORE, THESE TERMS CONTAIN IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS IN (SECTION 2), DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES (SECTION 6), LIMITATION OF LIABILITY (SECTION 10) AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER (SECTION 14).
